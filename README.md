**Description:** Lost N Found is an interactive social web application where different registered users at USC are able to anonymously make public appreciation posts that show up on a central home page. Inspired by the @usc.missedconnections Instagram page.

**Features:**
1. Register page: Allows users to register by providing a username, email and password. This information will be stored in the backend database. 
2. Login page: Allow users to log in with their registered username and password.
3. Posting wall (Home page): Allows users to post and view other peopleâ€™s posts. Logged in users can like posts. Most recent posts will appear at the top.
4. Create post page: Allows users to create a text-based post that will then be uploaded to the main posting wall.

**Deployment instructions:**
1. Run Script.SQL in MySQL. This will set up the database and create the tables necessary to run the program.
2. Run the program using Java 14 and Tomcat 9.
